# Burp File Fuzzer
This extension generates synthetic files of different types by appending random bytes to file headers.
It is based on my CLI fuzzer, [httpfuzz](https://github.com/joncooperworks/httpfuzz).
Burp File Fuzzer should be used with Burp Intruder to quickly determine what file types can be uploaded.

## Warning
Only use this extension on targets that you have full permission to test.
I am not responsible for anything stupid, immoral or illegal you do with this.
