# Burp File Fuzzer
This extension generates synthetic files of different types by appending random bytes to file headers.
It is based on my CLI fuzzer, [httpfuzz](https://github.com/joncooperworks/httpfuzz).
Burp File Fuzzer should be used with Burp Intruder to quickly determine what file types can be uploaded.

## Usage
Burp File Fuzzer will generate files of different types.
It provides two payload generators: one that generates files and one that generates filenames.

It should be used in Pitchfork mode with injection points placed on the file and filename.
This will cause Burp File Fuzzer to generate synthetic files and appropriate filenames.

Set the payload set according to the position of your filename and file contents.
The filename will usually be first in multipart requests.

Payloads for both filenames and synthetic files should be extension generated by Filename Generator and File Generator
respectively.

For best results, disable URL encoding for filenames to prevent the "." in filenames from being URL encoded.

## Warning
Only use this extension on targets that you have full permission to test.
I am not responsible for anything stupid, immoral or illegal you do with this.
